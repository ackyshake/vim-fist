# fist.vim
Fast, no hassle, minimal, super awesome Gist-ing for Vim.

<sub>If there were any more superlatives, I would be charging for this!</sub>


## Dependencies

- [gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist.git)


## Install

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/ajh17/vim-fist.git


## Setup

First, you want to make sure you have the gist command line setup and happy:

    [sudo] gem install gist
    gist --login

And you're done! Why are you still reading this? Go fist!


## FAQ
> What is the deal with the name "Fist"?

Taken from "**F**ast G**ist** for Vim that doesn't suck and doesn't require
another vim dependency plugin because that's stupid." Or because "Gisty" was
too good and was already taken. Or because the Author
racked his brain and couldn't think of anything else. You decide! Either way,
Fist.vim was born!

> Why another gist plugin for Vim?

Mostly as a (small) exercise, but which one would you rather use? A 80 line plugin or
a 1000 line plugin if both do essentially the same thing?
